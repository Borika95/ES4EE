# Expert System Shell for Energy Efficiency (ESS4EE)

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the **Expert System Shell for Energy Efficiency (ES4EE)** - a template for the development of expert systems for improving energy efficiency in manufacturing. ES4EE is implemented using Jupyter Notebook, providing a flexible and user-friendly environment for both expert system developers and end-users.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: The system shell is built with modular components, allowing for easy extension and customization.
- **Knowledge Representation**: Supports declarative knowledge representation, using rule-based systems to model domain knowledge.
- **Energy Efficiency Optimization**: Specialized modules to identify inefficiencies and recommend improvements in energy consumption for manufacturing processes.
- **Process Integration**: Enables the connection to other technical systems for unidirectional or bidirectional data transfer.

## Install Required Libraries
Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies using the following command:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
